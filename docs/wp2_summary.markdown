# StemBot MVP Work Package 2: Core UI & File Uploads Summary (September 9 - September 22, 2025)

## Overview
**Goal**: Build the dashboard, bot creation form, and bot list for the StemBot MVP, with file upload functionality to Supabase Storage and basic PDF parsing.  
**Duration**: 2 weeks (~40 hours, including 5 hours for learning/debugging).  
**Tools/Platforms**:  
- Next.js (frontend with Tailwind CSS).  
- Supabase (Storage for PDFs, database for bot metadata).  
- pdfjs-dist (planned for PDF parsing, deferred to WP3).  
- GitHub (version control, `stembot-mvp` repo).  
- Grok (AI for code generation and debugging).  

**Milestone Achieved**: Dashboard with bot list, bot creation form with PDF upload, Supabase integration, and redirect to dashboard after successful upload. Placeholder PDF parsing implemented, with full `pdfjs-dist` parsing planned for WP3.

## Tasks Completed

### Days 6-8: Dashboard UI (12 hours, September 9-11, 2025)
- **Task**: Created `/dashboard/page.tsx` with a responsive Tailwind CSS layout (sidebar, main panel) displaying a bot list and a "Create Bot" button.
- **Output**: Dashboard page accessible at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`, showing mock bot data.
- **Check**: Verified responsive layout and button functionality locally.

### Days 9-11: Bot Creation Form and PDF Upload (12 hours, September 12-14, 2025)
- **Task**: Built `/create-bot/page.tsx` with a form for bot name and PDF upload (<5MB) to Supabase Storage. Implemented authentication check and UI feedback (loading state, success message).
- **Output**: Form uploads PDFs to the `bots` bucket, saves metadata to the `bots` table, and shows a success message.
- **Check**: Uploaded PDFs appear in Supabase Storage, metadata saved in `bots` table.

### Day 3 (Task 2): PDF Parsing, Redirect, Testing, and Reflection (4 hours, September 14, 2025)
- **Parse PDF (1.5 hours)**:
  - Attempted to use `pdfjs-dist` for parsing but encountered a Node.js compatibility issue: `Warning: Please use the legacy build in Node.js environments. ReferenceError: DOMMatrix is not defined`.
  - Decision: Used a placeholder in `lib/pdf-utils.ts` (`getPDFInfo`) to return mock data (`pageCount: 1`, `firstPageText: 'PDF content will be processed for AI embeddings in WP3'`).
  - Console output confirmed: `PDF basic info: {pageCount: 1, firstPageText: 'PDF content will be processed for AI embeddings in WP3', metadata: {…}}`.
  - Check: Console logs basic PDF info as required.
- **Redirect (0.5 hour)**:
  - Implemented redirect to `/dashboard` after a 2-second success message using `useRouter` from `next/navigation`.
  - Check: Redirect to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` works after successful upload.
- **Testing (1 hour)**:
  - Tested full flow: Enter bot name, upload valid PDF, verify file in Supabase Storage, confirm console logs, and redirect.
  - Edge case handling implemented (empty name, non-PDF, >5MB, invalid PDF format) via `validatePDF` and `validateForm`.
  - Committed changes to GitHub:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Bot creation form with PDF upload, parsing, and dashboard button"
    git push origin main
    ```
  - Check: Verified files on GitHub (`app/create-bot/page.tsx`, `lib/pdf-utils.ts`, `lib/supabase-storage.ts`). Confirmed `.env.local` excluded via `.gitignore`.
- **Reflection (1 hour)**:
  - Documented below under Challenges and WP3 Planning.

## Code Structure
- **Modular Approach**:
  - Separated logic into `lib/pdf-utils.ts` (validation, placeholder parsing) and `lib/supabase-storage.ts` (upload, database save) for maintainability.
  - `app/create-bot/page.tsx`: ~150 lines, handles form UI, validation, and submission.
  - Benefits: Reduced main file complexity, improved reusability, and easier debugging.
- **Key Files**:
  - `lib/pdf-utils.ts`: Validates PDFs (extension, size, `%PDF` signature) and returns placeholder PDF info.
  - `lib/supabase-storage.ts`: Uploads PDFs to `bots` bucket, saves metadata to `bots` table.
  - `app/create-bot/page.tsx`: Manages form, authentication, and UI feedback (loading, success, errors).

## Challenges
- **pdfjs-dist Issue**:
  - Attempted to import `pdfjs-dist` in `lib/pdf-utils.ts` but faced: `Warning: Please use the legacy build in Node.js environments. ReferenceError: DOMMatrix is not defined`.
  - Cause: `pdfjs-dist` standard build is incompatible with Next.js server-side Node.js environment.
  - Resolution: Used placeholder in `getPDFInfo` to meet WP2 logging requirements. Deferred full `pdfjs-dist` parsing to WP3 to avoid worker setup and compatibility issues.
- **Supabase Integration**:
  - Initial concerns about CORS or bucket permissions resolved by ensuring `bots` bucket is public and has correct policies (`INSERT` for authenticated users).
- **Form Usability**:
  - Success message with 2-second delay improves UX but could include bot name (e.g., “MathBot created successfully”) for clarity.

## WP3 Planning
- **Implement pdfjs-dist Parsing**:
  - Update `getPDFInfo` in `lib/pdf-utils.ts` to use `pdfjs-dist/legacy` build for Node.js compatibility.
  - Example:
    ```typescript
    import * as pdfjsLib from 'pdfjs-dist/legacy';
    pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = `//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/3.11.174/pdf.worker.min.js`;
    export const getPDFInfo = async (file: File): Promise<PDFInfo> => {
      const arrayBuffer = await file.arrayBuffer();
      const pdf = await pdfjsLib.getDocument({ data: arrayBuffer }).promise;
      const pageCount = pdf.numPages;
      const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
      const textContent = await page.getTextContent();
      const firstPageText = textContent.items.map((item: any) => item.str).join(' ');
      return { pageCount, firstPageText, metadata: { fileName: file.name, fileSize: file.size } };
    };
    ```
  - Test with actual PDFs to ensure accurate `pageCount` and `firstPageText`.
- **Store Parsed Data**:
  - Add `first_page_text` to `bots` table in `saveBotToDatabase` for WP3 embeddings:
    ```typescript
    await supabaseClient.from('bots').insert({
      name: botName,
      file_name: fileName,
      file_url: fileUrl,
      user_id: userId,
      page_count: pdfInfo?.pageCount,
      first_page_text: pdfInfo?.firstPageText,
      created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    });
    ```
- **Prepare for AI Integration**:
  - Use `file_url` or `first_page_text` from `bots` table for OpenAI embeddings and Pinecone storage in WP3.
  - Test parsing performance with larger PDFs to optimize for WP3.

## Reflection
- **Learning**: Modularizing code into `lib` files improved maintainability and reduced `app/create-bot/page.tsx` complexity. Placeholder parsing was a pragmatic choice for WP2.
- **Usability**: Form UI is intuitive, with clear error messages and loading states. Success message delay enhances UX but could be personalized.
- **Next Steps**: Focus on `pdfjs-dist/legacy` integration in WP3 to enable full PDF parsing for AI embeddings, ensuring compatibility with Next.js.

## Status
- **Completed**: Dashboard UI, bot creation form, PDF upload, placeholder parsing, redirect, and basic error handling.
- **Verified**: Console logs, Supabase Storage uploads, database saves, GitHub commits, and redirect functionality.
- **On Track**: WP2 completed within 40 hours, ready for WP3 (AI Integration, September 23 - October 6, 2025).
